## Day 1: Reflection

Throughout my first day in the module electronics for the rest of us, we discussed various aspects connecting many concepts from programming through GitHub, to creating websites and using various commands to personalize our own website through coding. Generally, I am interested in taking this module as I do have past experience in python and JavaScript. My knowledge on using both of these programs is still at the beginnerâ€™s level as I have only taken a couple of courses online outside of school at McMaster University. I would really like to get more involved and improve my programing skills as it is something that has always interested me. I can in fact incorporate these skills in GIS, as this is in fact the path I am choosing to pursue in my future. I enjoy working on computers and I am always willing to expand my skills, hence why I chose to take this course. I also hope to take away various things from this. I hope to gather more computer programming skills as well as to incorporate these skills in the future. Having more introductory knowledge in programming will allow me more experience in order to proceed with my learning in the intermediate level. This will allow me to gain more certification and at the end of it all, who knows, I may just end up going back to school to get another degree in programming if I see it interests me more. This experience will truly allow me to see more then the few perspectives and programming methods that I have already learned.

Code for Themistor and RGB LED
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/*
Adafruit Arduino - Lesson 3. RGB LED
*/
/*
 * Inputs ADC Value from Thermistor and outputs Temperature in Celsius
 *  requires: include <math.h>
 * Utilizes the Steinhart-Hart Thermistor Equation:
 *    Temperature in Kelvin = 1 / {A + B[ln(R)] + C[ln(R)]3}
 *    where A = 0.001129148, B = 0.000234125 and C = 8.76741E-08
 *
 * These coefficients seem to work fairly universally, which is a bit of a
 * surprise.
 *
 * Schematic:
 *   [Ground] -- [10k-pad-resistor] -- | -- [thermistor] --[Vcc (5 or 3.3v)]
 *                                               |
 *                                          Analog Pin 0
 *
 * In case it isn't obvious (as it wasn't to me until I thought about it), the analog ports
 * measure the voltage between 0v -> Vcc which for an Arduino is a nominal 5v, but for (say)
 * a JeeNode, is a nominal 3.3v.
 *
 * The resistance calculation uses the ratio of the two resistors, so the voltage
 * specified above is really only required for the debugging that is commented out below
 *
 * Resistance = PadResistor * (1024/ADC -1)  
 *
 * I have used this successfully with some CH Pipe Sensors (https://www.atcsemitec.co.uk/pdfdocs/ch.pdf)
 * which be obtained from https://www.rapidonline.co.uk.
