## Day 1: Reflection

Throughout my first day in the module electronics for the rest of us, we discussed various aspects connecting many concepts from programming through GitHub, to creating websites and using various commands to personalize our own website through coding. Generally, I am interested in taking this module as I do have past experience in python and JavaScript. My knowledge on using both of these programs is still at the beginnerâ€™s level as I have only taken a couple of courses online outside of school at McMaster University. I would really like to get more involved and improve my programing skills as it is something that has always interested me. I can in fact incorporate these skills in GIS, as this is in fact the path I am choosing to pursue in my future. I enjoy working on computers and I am always willing to expand my skills, hence why I chose to take this course. I also hope to take away various things from this. I hope to gather more computer programming skills as well as to incorporate these skills in the future. Having more introductory knowledge in programming will allow me more experience in order to proceed with my learning in the intermediate level. This will allow me to gain more certification and at the end of it all, who knows, I may just end up going back to school to get another degree in programming if I see it interests me more. This experience will truly allow me to see more then the few perspectives and programming methods that I have already learned.

![RGB LED THERM CIRCUIT](images/IMAGE RGBLED-THEMISTOR.jpg)

This is a simple circuit that uses RGB to power a light and make it switch colours. There is also a second part attached to this. The thermistor measures the room temperature based off the way the program was coded. The thermistor calculates the temperature approximately every 5 seconds. As the temperature increases, the light turns red. As it descends, and gets below 20, it goes blue, an anywhere between 20 and 30 (Fahrenheit), the light will remain a green colour. The part that was challenging about this was combining the two different types of codes. It took various attempts with trial and error in order to know what parts to copy into the void setup and void loop sections in order to make it function properly. This circuit worked relatively well, and all code was very clear, although I had a common Cathode and therefore had to plug my final wire connecting to the light into the 5V port (Volts) rather than the ground to make it function. 


<!--
Upload your fully-commented Arduino sketch from your final Day 2 build task--a thermometer connected to an RDB LED--into your GitHub repository.
Provide a short (~150 words) summary of your work on this circuit:
- How does your device work?
- What was challenging? 
- What worked? What didn't? 
- Be sure to link to your code (in your GitHub repository) in the text of your response.

## Arduino build-off results
<!--
Upload your fully-commented Arduino sketch from the final product of your Arduino build-off into the top-level of your module GitHub repository.
In ~300 words, provide a final device description and product pitch: 
- What does it do? Use a table (created in markdown) to list and describe the features. You can use the template provided below. 
- Describe briefly how it works.
- How could it be used in everyday life (or maybe just in rare cases)? 
- Be sure to link to your code (in your GitHub repository) in the text of your response.
- Include a snippet of code using the ``` ``` characters to display the code properly. 
Finally, record a short (30 second) video of a 'product pitch' for your device. 
- Upload the video to Youtube, and use the sample code below to embed your video.

Below is an example of embedding a YouTube video in a markdown document for use in GitHub pages. 
Note that this video won't show when previewing the document in GitHub--it only works on the GitHub pages webpage. 
- Once your YouTube video is uploaded, right click and select ```<> Copy embed code```. 
- You can paste this code directly into your markdown document. 
- Note that you may want to adjust the width and height parameters to make it fit well in your webpage
